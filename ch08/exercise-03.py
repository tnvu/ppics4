# An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a
# phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym
# for “random access memory.” Write a program that allows the user to
# type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: The
# acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are not
# capitalized.

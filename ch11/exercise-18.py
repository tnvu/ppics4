# (Advanced) Here is a puzzle problem that can be solved with either some
# fancy analytic geometry (calculus) or a (relatively) simple simulation.
# Suppose you are located at the exact center of a cube. If you could look
# all around you in every direction, each wall of the cube would occupy %
# of your field of vision. Suppose you move toward one of the walls so that
# you are now halfway between it and the center of the cube. What fraction
# of your field of vision is now taken up by the closest wall? Hint: Use a
# Monte Carlo simulation that repeatedly “looks” in a random direction and
# counts how many times it sees the wall.

# TODO(thien): I need to think about this problem a lot more

# Monte Carlo techniques can be used to estimate the value of pi. Suppose
# you have a round dartboard that just fits inside of a square cabinet. If
# you throw darts randomly, the proportion that hit the dartboard vs. those
# that hit the cabinet (in the corners not covered by the board) will be
# determined by the relative area of the dartboard and the cabinet. If n is
# the total number of darts randomly thrown (that land within the confines of
# the cabinet), and h is the number that hit the board, it is easy to show 
# that 
#           pi =~ 4(h)
#                  (n)
# Write a program that accepts the “number of darts” as an input and
# then performs a simulation to estimate pi. Hint: You can use 2*random()
# - 1 to generate the x and y coordinates of a random point inside a 2x2
# square centered at (0,0). The point lies inside the inscribed circle
# if x^2 + y^2 <= 1
